## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom fonts using `@font-face`
- Responsive design using Media Queries

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me refine my understanding of several key web development concepts, including the use of custom fonts and responsive design techniques. Here's a breakdown of what I learned:

1. **Custom Fonts:**
   I integrated multiple font weights and styles using the `@font-face` rule, which allowed me to include and use custom fonts directly from local files. This approach gave me greater control over the typography used in the project.

   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: "Inter";
     src: url("../assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf") format("truetype"),
       url("../static/Inter-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
     font-weight: 400;
     font-style: normal;
   }

   @font-face {
     font-family: "Inter";
     src: url("../static/Inter-Semibold.ttf") format("truetype");
     font-weight: 600;
     font-style: normal;
   }
   ```

2. **CSS Custom Properties:**
   Using CSS custom properties (variables) helped streamline the styling process. For example, defining font sizes and weights as variables made it easy to maintain consistency throughout the project and quickly apply changes.

   ```css
   :root {
     --small-font: 14px;
     --large-font: 24px;
     --regular: 400;
     --bold: 600;
   }
   ```

3. **Responsive Design:**
   I employed a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the design is responsive and looks great on all screen sizes. Media queries were used to adjust the layout for larger screens, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

   ```css
   @media (min-width: 450px) {
     li {
       width: 305px;
     }
   }
   ```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to continue refining my skills in:

- **CSS Grid:** Expanding my knowledge to create more complex, grid-based layouts.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improving web font loading strategies, such as using `font-display: swap` and serving fonts in WOFF2 format for faster load times.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring all interactive elements are fully accessible by enhancing focus states and keyboard navigation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This resource helped me understand the correct way to implement custom fonts in CSS.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A comprehensive guide that clarified how to use Flexbox for responsive layouts.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Even though I used local fonts, Google Fonts is a great resource for finding web fonts and understanding best practices for font integration.
