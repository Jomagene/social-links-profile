## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom fonts using `@font-face`

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me refine my understanding of using custom fonts in a web project. I integrated multiple font weights and styles using the `@font-face` rule, which allowed me to include and use custom fonts directly from local files.

Additionally, I gained more confidence in using Flexbox to create responsive layouts with centered and column-based alignment. Here’s a piece of CSS code I’m proud of:

```css
.flex-center {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

````

This snippet demonstrates how simple properties in Flexbox can achieve a clean, centered layout.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further explore:

- **CSS Grid:** To enhance my layouts and create more complex, grid-based designs.
- **Performance Optimization:** Focusing on optimizing web font loading strategies, such as using `font-display: swap` and serving fonts in WOFF2 format.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring that all interactive elements are fully accessible by improving focus states and keyboard navigation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This resource helped me understand the correct way to implement custom fonts in CSS.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A comprehensive guide that clarified how to use Flexbox for responsive layouts.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Even though I used local fonts, Google Fonts is a great resource for finding web fonts and understanding best practices for font integration.
